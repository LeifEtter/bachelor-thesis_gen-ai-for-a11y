               However, while many such AI/CV-based mobile applications are now

               process, the frequent modifications can increase software
               complexity and negatively impact its global quality when
               conducted in an unstructured way. The evolutive nature of mobile
               environments led researchers to investigate how mobile app
               evolution impacts complexity, security, resource consumption,
               maintainability, usability, and accessibility. In particular,
               there has been limited research on the impact of app updates on
               mobile accessibility: most studies focused on tracking the
               number of accessibility violations found by automated tools
               across successive versions of a small set of applications. In a
               previous work, we made a contribution to this field by
               identifying accessibility reviews associated with app updates
               and prompting ChatGPT-4 to provide an overview of the main
               accessibility issues and enhancements perceived by users in the
               new releases of a mobile app. In this manuscript, we extend our
               previous work by adopting manual content analysis to delve
               deeper into our research questions and by adding new research
               questions associated with the identification of reviews linked
               to app updates, user characteristics, WCAG principles and
               guidelines, and user demands reported in accessibility reviews.
               Our results show that the accessibility barriers reported by
               users are mostly linked to the WCAG 2.2 Perceivable principle,
               and the Distinguishable and Adaptable guidelines, which includes
               poor color scheme, small font size, unlabeled elements, and lack
               of customization options. Accordingly, the consequences of the
               lack of accessibility is mainly connected to the difficult users
               experience to perceive elements of the interface (e.g. difficult
               to read and distinguish content, watch videos) and to use screen
               readers, in addition to feel discriminated against. The most

  abstract  = "AbstractWeb accessibility evaluation is a costly process that
               usually requires manual intervention. Currently, large language
               model (LLM) based systems have gained popularity and shown
               promising capabilities to perform tasks that seemed impossible
               or required programming knowledge specific to a given area or
               were supposed to be impossible to be performed automatically.
               Our research explores whether an LLM-based system would be able
               to evaluate web accessibility success criteria that require
               manual evaluation. Three specific success criteria of the Web
               Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) that currently require
               manual checks were tested: 1.1.1 Non-text Content, 2.4.4 Link
               Purpose (In Context), and 3.1.2 Language of Parts. LLM-based
               scripts were developed to evaluate the test cases. Results were
               compared against current web accessibility evaluators. While
               automated accessibility evaluators were unable to reliably test
               the three WCAG criteria, often missing or only warning about
               issues, the LLM-based scripts successfully identified
               accessibility issues the tools missed, achieving overall 87.18\%
               detection across the test cases. Conclusion The results
               demonstrate LLMs can augment automated accessibility testing to
               catch issues that pure software testing misses today. Further
               research should expand evaluation across more test cases and
               types of content.",

  abstract  = "Websites are integral to people's daily lives, with billions in
               use today. However, due to limited awareness of accessibility
               and its guidelines, developers often release web apps that are
               inaccessible to people with disabilities, who make up around
               16\% of the global population. To ensure a baseline of
               accessibility, software engineers rely on automated checkers
               that assess a webpage's compliance based on predefined rules.
               Unfortunately, these tools typically cover only a small subset
               of accessibility guidelines and often overlook violations that
               require a semantic understanding of the webpage. The advent of
               generative AI, known for its ability to comprehend textual and
               visual content, has created new possibilities for detecting
               accessibility violations. We began by studying the most widely
               used guideline, WCAG, to determine the testable success criteria
               that generative AI could address. This led to the development of
               an automated tool called GenA11y, which extracts elements from a
               page related to each success criterion and inputs them into an
               LLM prompted to detect accessibility issues on the web.
               Evaluations of GenA11y showed its effectiveness, with a
               precision of 94.5\% and a recall of 87.61\%. Additionally, when
               tested on real websites, GenA11y identified an average of eight
               more types of accessibility violations than the combination of
