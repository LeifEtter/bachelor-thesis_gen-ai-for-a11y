abstract = {The term "artificial intelligence" is a buzzword today and is heavily used to market products, services, research, conferences, and more. It is scientifically disputed which types of products and services do actually qualify as "artificial intelligence" versus simply advanced computer technologies mimicking aspects of natural intelligence.Yet it is undisputed that, despite often inflationary use of the term, there are mainstream products and services today that for decades were only thought to be science fiction. They range from industrial automation, to self-driving cars, robotics, and consumer electronics for smart homes, workspaces, education, and many more contexts.Several technological advances enable what is commonly referred to as "artificial intelligence". It includes connected computers and the Internet of Things (IoT), open and big data, low cost computing and storage, and many more. Yet regardless of the definition of the term artificial intelligence, technological advancements in this area provide immense potential, especially for people with disabilities.In this paper we explore some of these potential in the context of web accessibility. We review some existing products and services, and their support for web accessibility. We propose accessibility conformance evaluation as one potential way forward, to accelerate the uptake of artificial intelligence, to improve web accessibility.},
