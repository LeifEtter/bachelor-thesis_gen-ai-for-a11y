abstract = {From curating the layout of a resume to selecting filters for social media, creating and configuring visual content allows individuals to express identity, communicate intent, and engage socially, yet blind individuals often face significant barriers to such expressive practices. Prior accessibility research primarily addresses functional content configuration, leaving little understanding of blind individuals’ expressive visual creation needs. To better understand and support these needs, we conducted a two-stage study: first, we interviewed 10 blind participants to understand their motivations, current practices, and barriers in visual expression, and to ideate on potential visual editing support; second, based on interview insights, we developed an interactive prototype (VizXpress) that provides real-time feedback on visual aesthetics using a vision-language model and supports automated and manual visual editing controls. We used VizXpress as a design probe to further explore accessible design opportunities for visual expression. Our findings highlight many blind users’ strong interest in creating visually expressive content, nuanced informational requirements for subjective aesthetics (e.g., color, mood, lighting), and ongoing accessibility challenges with visual creative tools. Grounded in these insights, we propose design implications including richer aesthetic feedback, controlled intelligent editing, and accessible manual editing mechanisms.},
