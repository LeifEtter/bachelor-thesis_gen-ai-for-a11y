abstract = {Sighted and blind and low vision (BLV) creators alike use videos to communicate with broad audiences. Yet, video editing remains inaccessible to BLV creators. Our formative study revealed that current video editing tools make it difficult to access the visual content, assess the visual quality, and efficiently navigate the timeline. We present &nbsp;AVscript, an accessible text-based video editor. &nbsp;AVscript enables users to edit their video using a script that embeds the video’s visual content, visual errors (e.g., dark or blurred footage), and speech. Users can also efficiently navigate between scenes and visual errors or locate objects in the frame or spoken words of interest. A comparison study (N=12) showed that &nbsp;AVscript significantly lowered BLV creators’ mental demands while increasing confidence and independence in video editing. We further demonstrate the potential of &nbsp;AVscript through an exploratory study (N=3) where BLV creators edited their own footage.},

abstract = {Conventional online shopping platforms typically prioritise user experience design centred around visual elements, heavily relying on visual cues for product information and user navigation. This design pattern presents barriers for Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) customers. Existing accommodations focus primarily on ensuring compatibility of the platforms with assistive software such as screen readers. While assistive software enable BLV customers to access online shopping services, they often involve compromises in user experience during the conversion of visual elements to auditory ones. With the rapid advancement of Generative AI (GenAI), particularly voice- and dialogue-based interactions driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), we prototyped an innovative demo, EchoMall, aiming to explore the design of an enjoyable vision-free online shopping experience. By blending multiple LLMs and GenAI techniques, EchoMall potentially allows BLV customers to engage in an intuitive online shopping process without assistive software and creates new market opportunities.},

Whilst previous research has focused on GenAI's emerging role in artistic work, our study highlights its potential in supporting non-creative aspects of artistic practice, which are often overlooked yet critical for workload management of disabled artists. Through in-depth semi-structured interviews with 5 disabled visual artists, we explore the perceived benefits and barriers of using GenAI, particularly in terms of accessibility, cognitive demands, ethical concerns, and financial constraints. Our findings suggest that whilst GenAI can increase productivity, reduce cognitive load, and promote equity, it also presents challenges related to transparency, bias, interface complexity, and job displacement fears. We conclude by calling for more inclusive and affordable GenAI tools, improved accessible interfaces, ethical governance, and personalised support to enable disabled creatives in their professional practices.},

abstract = {Building 3-D models is challenging for blind and low-vision (BLV) users due to the inherent complexity of 3-D models and the lack of support for non-visual interaction in existing tools. To address this issue, we introduce A11yShape, a novel system designed to help BLV users who possess basic programming skills understand, modify, and iterate on 3-D models. A11yShape leverages LLMs and integrates with OpenSCAD, a popular open-source editor that generates 3-D models from code. Key functionalities of A11yShape include accessible descriptions of 3-D models, version control to track changes in models and code, and a hierarchical representation of model components. Most importantly, A11yShape employs a cross-representation highlighting mechanism to synchronize semantic selections across all model representations—code, semantic hierarchy, AI description, and 3-D rendering. We conducted a multi-session user study with four BLV programmers, where, after an initial tutorial session, participants independently completed 12 distinct models across two testing sessions, achieving results that aligned with their own satisfaction. The result demonstrates that participants were able to comprehend provided 3-D models, as well as independently create and modify 3-D models—tasks that were previously impossible without assistance from sighted individuals.},

Across workflows, creators actively negotiated agency and trust, maintaining creative control while bridging sensory gaps. We discuss the need for flexible, interdependent collaboration models, inclusive human-AI workflows, and diverse storytelling practices. This work broadens accessibility research in HCI by examining how technology and social factors intersect in low-resource contexts, suggesting ways to better support disabled creators globally.},

abstract = {Presentation software like Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides remains largely inaccessible for blind users because screen readers are not well suited to 2-D “artboards” that contain different objects in arbitrary arrangements lacking any inherent reading order. To investigate this problem, prior work by Zhang \& Wobbrock (2023) developed multimodal interaction techniques in a prototype system called A11yBoard, but their system was limited to a single artboard in a self-contained prototype and was unable to support real-world use. In this work, we present a major extension of A11yBoard that expands upon its initial interaction techniques, addresses numerous real-world issues, and makes it deployable with Google Slides. We describe the new features developed for A11yBoard for Google Slides along with our participatory design process with a blind co-author. We also present two case studies based on real-world deployments showing that participants were able to independently complete slide reading and authoring tasks that were not possible without sighted assistance previously. We conclude with several design guidelines for making accessible digital content creation tools.},

To address this gap, we explore user-driven AI-generated descriptions, enabling BLV viewers to control both the timing and level of detail of the descriptions they receive. In a study, 20 BLV participants activated audio descriptions for seven different video genres with two levels of detail: concise and detailed. Our findings reveal differences in the preferred frequency and level of detail of ADs for different videos, participants’ sense of control with this style of AD delivery, and its limitations. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of future AD tools for BLV users.},

To improve the accessibility of animated GIFs for BLV users, we provide a system called Ga11y (pronounced “galley”), for creating GIF annotations. Ga11y combines the power of machine intelligence and crowdsourcing and has three components: an Android client for submitting annotation requests, a backend server and database, and a web interface where volunteers can respond to annotation requests. We evaluated three human annotation interfaces and employ the one that yielded the best annotation quality.

On this basis, we develop AutoChemplete, an interactive labeling tool for chemical structural formulas. It ingests images and uses machine learning to predict the molecule. With a similarity search in the solution space, we enable even novices to simply pick from options. From this we are able to generate accessible representations. We conduct fifteen think-aloud sessions with participants of varying domain expertise and find support of different annotation styles simultaneously.

However, when headers are not available or not appropriately marked up, they can cause serious difficulties. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a tool for automatically generating headers for screen readers with topicalisation and labelling algorithms. The proposed tool uses Natural Language Processing techniques to divide a web document into topic segments and label each segment based on its content. We conducted an initial user study with eight blind and partially-sighted screen reader users. The evaluation involved tasks with questions answered by participants with information from texts with and without automatically generated headers. Results provided preliminary indicators of improvement in performance and reduction of cognitive load. The findings contribute to knowledge to improve tools to aid in text exploration. It also provides initial empirical evidence to be further explored to analyze the impact of automatically-generated headings in improving performance and reducing cognitive load for blind users.},

This study addresses this gap by examining reviews related to visual impairments and ocular conditions and linking them to accessibility guidelines. We used a public dataset of 4,999 accessibility-related reviews of Android apps, applying manual content analysis to associate feedback with the BBC Mobile Accessibility Guidelines.

abstract="For users who are unfamiliar with technology or rely on assistive tools such as screen readers, interacting with a web page can be challenging. Ensuring a seamless experience requires a well-designed user interface (UI) that prioritizes accessibility and usability. However, achieving this target demands specialized expertise from developers and can involve significant effort. In this context, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has become a valuable aid for improving access to information and facilitating interaction with web interfaces. To effectively enhance user interaction---such as accessing services or specific functionalities---AI-driven tools must first be capable of understanding the structure and content of a web page. This study investigates if GAIs can be exploited to assist the user when navigating through a website, describing the site contents, explaining the interface structure and interactive elements, and suggesting actions or procedures to follow to perform a certain task or accomplish a specific goal. This kind of assistive technology can benefit not only visually impaired people but also persons with cognitive impairment and, more generally, people that are not ``skilled'' with modern web applications, like seniors. Specifically, thirteen popular websites were analyzed by asking Copilot one hundred questions. Results suggest that GAIs have the potential to assist people in web tasks. However, limitations have still been detected, with 20{\%} of completely erroneous answers received from the navigation and interaction questions and 15{\%} for those related to structure, mainly detected in pages having scarce accessibility and sites having a complex HTML structure, respectively.",

abstract = { Visually impaired individuals, estimated at 285 million globally, rely heavily on-screen readers for internet access. However, much of the visually available information, such as the relationship between webpage elements, does not translate well to its textual representation and must be always kept in memory, limiting contextual interactions. To address this challenge, we developed Touch Matrix Assistive Technology Navigator (TOMAT), an open-source system that works alongside screen readers to provide an interactive, audio-tactile representation of webpage structure and enable contextual interactions. Our study employed a participatory design approach, involving visually impaired users, healthcare professionals, engineers, and community organizations in co-design sessions, prototype demonstrations, and focus groups. The resulting system extracts and presents non-linear web information at multiple levels of detail, allowing users to dynamically adjust granularity and efficiently navigate and interact with web content. Participants reported that TOMAT enhanced their understanding of webpage structure and provided an intuitive complement to screen reader software. The findings suggest TOMAT has the potential to improve the internet navigation experience for visually impaired users, fostering greater independence and digital participation. To support further development and collaboration, TOMAT’s source files have been released under an open-source license. }

This study investigates the effect of providing an overview of search results to VI users. We present a novel interactive search engine interface called InteractSE to support VI users during the results exploration stage in order to improve their interactive experience and web search efficiency. An overview of the search results is generated using an unsupervised machine learning approach to present the discovered concepts via a formal concept analysis that is domain-independent. These concepts are arranged in a multi-level tree following a hierarchical order and covering all retrieved documents that share maximal features. The InteractSE interface was evaluated by 16 legally blind users and compared with the Google search engine interface for complex search tasks. The evaluation results were obtained based on both quantitative (as task completion time) and qualitative (as participants’ feedback) measures. These results are promising and indicate that InteractSE enhances the search efficiency and consequently advances user experience. Our observations and analysis of the user interactions and feedback yielded design suggestions to support VI users when exploring and interacting with search results.},

Typically, however, these interfaces provide only limited audio styling, collapsing rich visual design into a static audio output style with a single synthesized voice. To explore the potential for more aesthetic and intuitive sound design for websites, we prompted 14 professional sound designers to create auditory website mockups and interviewed them about their designs and rationale. Our findings reveal their prioritized design considerations (aesthetics and emotion, user engagement, audio clarity, information dynamics, and interactivity), specific sound design ideas to support each consideration (e.g., replacing spoken labels with short, memorable audio expressions), and challenges with applying sound design practices to auditory websites. These findings provide promising direction for how to support designers in creating richer auditory website experiences.},

In a pilot with 3 and a main study with 8 BLV students, we identify multi-modal interaction patterns and confirm the importance of two separate roles of speakers: a voice assistant and a screen reader. The conversation is driven by user's multi-modal speech input and hand gestures provided sequentially or in parallel. Verbal references to cells by spoken addresses, values, and formulas can be embodied as tangible objects to unify tactile and verbal representations.",

abstract = {User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier to access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents typically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices or making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user agency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the cheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from several equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with different flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce Morae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task execution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large multimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots, and prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a study over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users complete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences, as compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this work exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the automation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.},

This digital divide is exacerbated by the incapability to browse the web spatially—an affordance that leverages spatial reasoning, which sighted users often rely on. In this work, we investigate the value of and opportunities for BLV screen-reader users to browse websites spatially (e.g., understanding page layouts). We additionally explore at-scale website layout understanding as a feature of desktop screen readers. We created a technology probe, WebNExt, to facilitate our investigation. Specifically, we conducted a lab study with eight participants and a five-day field study with four participants to evaluate spatial browsing using WebNExt. Our findings show that participants found spatial browsing intuitive and fulfilling, strengthening their connection to the design of web pages. Furthermore, participants envisioned spatial browsing as a step toward reducing the digital divide.},

Participants approached the tool with curiosity, investigating its potential for inspiration, evaluation, and fragment generation for multisensory works, while drawing clear boundaries around authorship and creative agency. Digital artists expressed particular vulnerability to assumptions of overreliance on AI, while others saw limited opportunities to embed embodied, adaptive, and intersectional elements central to their practice. We contribute to HCI by foregrounding BLV artists’ perspectives and identifying design opportunities for generative tools that prioritize accessibility, support dialogic meaning-making, and validate BLV artistic authorship in visual fields.},

By analyzing 3,467 real-world VQA cases from BLV users, we developed a manifestation-scenario-based dual-dimensional hallucination typology, uncovering eight scenarios and five types of hallucinations. Through interviews with 16 BLV users, we examined their awareness levels, detection strategies, mental models of hallucinations, and their tolerance of associated risks, identifying key gaps between their perceptions and real situations. By designing with 12 BLV users, we uncovered their expectations for hallucination-mitigating solutions, including enhanced information provision, transparency in processing, verification strategies, and feedback mechanisms.},

In this study, we explore the accessibility and usability of the interfaces of four popular AI-based tools via screen readers through a combination of semi-automated evaluations and inspections conducted by both sighted and blind accessibility experts and screen readers with more than 20 years of experience. Navigation, labeling of control elements, feedback mechanisms, and prompt handling were considered in the study. The results point to usability difficulties in all tools, particularly in navigation structure, clarity of feedback and interactive elements. Although this work empirically explores the accessibility of AI-based tools it brings out the first critical issues that deserve further investigation. However, they are based on a small group of experts and thus should be considered preliminary and useful for future studies.},

As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

abstract = {Interaction with web data records typically involves accessing auxiliary webpage segments such as filters, sort options, search form, and multi-page links. As these segments are usually scattered all across the screen, it is arduous and tedious for blind users who rely on screen readers to access the segments, given that content navigation with screen readers is predominantly one-dimensional, despite the available support for skipping content via either special keyboard shortcuts or selective navigation. The extant techniques to overcome inefficient web screen reader interaction have mostly focused on general web content navigation, and as such they provide little to no support for data record-specific interaction activities such as filtering and sorting – activities that are equally important for enabling quick and easy access to the desired data records. To fill this void, we present InSupport, a browser extension that: (i) employs custom-built machine learning models to automatically extract auxiliary segments on any webpage containing data records, and (ii) provides an instantly accessible proxy one-stop interface for easily navigating the extracted segments using basic screen reader shortcuts. An evaluation study with 14 blind participants showed significant improvement in usability with InSupport, driven by increased reduction in interaction time and the number of key presses, compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

abstract = {Navigating unfamiliar websites is challenging for users with visual impairments. Although many websites offer visual cues to facilitate access to pages/features most websites are expected to have (e.g., log in at the top right), such visual shortcuts are not accessible to users with visual impairments. Moreover, although such pages serve the same functionality across websites (e.g., to log in, to sign up), the location, wording, and navigation path of links to these pages vary from one website to another. Such inconsistencies are challenging for users with visual impairments, especially for users of screen readers, who often need to linearly listen to content of pages to figure out how to access certain website features. To study how to improve access to main website features, we iteratively designed and tested a command-based approach for main features of websites via a browser extension powered by machine learning and human input. The browser extension gives users a way to access high-level website features (e.g., log in, find stores, contact) via keyboard commands. We tested the browser extension in a lab setting with 15 Internet users, including 9 users with visual impairments and 6 without. Our study showed that commands for main website features can greatly improve the experience of users with visual impairments. People without visual impairments also found command-based access helpful when visiting unfamiliar, cluttered, or infrequently visited websites, suggesting that this approach can support users with visual impairments while also benefiting other user groups (i.e., universal design). Our study reveals concerns about the handling of unsupported commands and the availability and trustworthiness of human input. We discuss how websites, browsers, and assistive technologies could incorporate a command-based paradigm to enhance web accessibility and provide more consistency on the web to benefit users with varied abilities when navigating unfamiliar or complex websites.},

abstract = {People with visual impairments (PVI) access photos through image descriptions. Thus far, research has studied what PVI expect in these descriptions mostly regarding functional purposes (e.g., identifying an object) and when engaging with online, publicly available images. Extending this research, we interviewed 30 PVI to understand their expectations for image descriptions when viewing, taking, searching, and reminiscing with personal photos on their own devices. We show how their expectations varied across photo activities and often went well beyond identifying objects in photos. Based on our findings, we propose design opportunities for generating and providing image descriptions for personal photo use by PVI. The design opportunities for PVI also point to novel support for the sighted for using image descriptions to enrich their experience of photos.&nbsp;},

Question answering (QA) systems have the potential to support visualization interpretation and exploration without overwhelming blind and low vision (BLV) users. To investigate if and how QA systems can help BLV users in working with visualizations, we conducted a Wizard of Oz study with 24 BLV people where participants freely posed queries about four visualizations. We collected 979 queries and mapped them to popular analytic task taxonomies. We found that retrieving value and finding extremum were the most common tasks, participants often made complex queries and used visual references, and the data topic notably influenced the queries. We compile a list of design considerations for accessible chart QA systems and make our question corpus publicly available to guide future research and development.},

abstract = {Blind and low-vision (BLV) students face significant barriers to timely access of visual STEM materials. Accessibility practitioners, such as braille transcribers and teachers of the visually impaired (TVIs), rely on manual and labor-intensive processes to produce accessible formats (e.g., braille, tactile graphics) of visual educational materials. To complement this effort and address ongoing accessibility gaps, we developed Kanak, an AI system that leverages generative intelligence to automate the generation of accessible STEM content, including text, math equations, and graphics. Through a comparative study with seven practitioners, we examined how Kanak supports traditional transcribing workflows and augments expert judgment. Our findings reveal how generative tools could complement practitioner expertise by providing context-aware formatting, proofreading support, and on-demand graphics generation. We conclude with design considerations for human-AI collaboration in transcribing work, positioning generative intelligence not as a replacement for expert insights, but as a catalyst for expanding equitable access.},

abstract = {Blind and low-vision (BLV) people face challenges watching sports due to the lack of accessibility of sports broadcasts. Currently, BLV people rely on descriptions from TV commentators, radio announcers, or their friends to understand the game. These descriptions, however, do not allow BLV viewers to visualize the action by themselves. We present Front Row, a system that automatically generates an immersive audio representation of sports broadcasts, specifically tennis, allowing BLV viewers to more directly perceive what is happening in the game. Front Row first recognizes gameplay from the video feed using computer vision, then renders players’ positions and shots via spatialized (3D) audio cues. User evaluations with 12 BLV participants show that Front Row gives BLV viewers a more accurate understanding of the game compared to TV and radio, enabling viewers to form their own opinions on players’ moods and strategies. We discuss future implications of Front Row and illustrate several applications, including a Front Row plug-in for video streaming platforms to enable BLV people to visualize the action in sports videos across the Web.},

abstract = {360° videos enable users to freely choose their viewing paths, but blind and low vision (BLV) users are often excluded from this interactive experience. To bridge this gap, we present Branch Explorer, a system that transforms 360° videos into branching narratives—stories that dynamically unfold based on viewer choices—to support interactive viewing for BLV audiences. Our formative study identified three key considerations for accessible branching narratives: providing diverse branch options, ensuring coherent story progression, and enabling immersive navigation among branches. To address these needs, Branch Explorer employs a multi-modal machine learning pipeline to generate diverse narrative paths, allowing users to flexibly make choices at detected branching points and seamlessly engage with each storyline through immersive audio guidance. Evaluation with 12 BLV viewers showed that Branch Explorer significantly enhanced user agency and engagement in 360° video viewing. Users also developed personalized strategies for exploring 360° content. We further highlight implications for supporting accessible exploration of videos and virtual environments.},

In this qualitative study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with ten (N=10) BLV participants, recruited based on divergences in prior survey ratings, to explore their perceptions of both human- and AI-generated ADs in contexts ranging from traditional film to short-form video and livestreams. Thematic analysis revealed five key themes: (1) information prioritization and genre-sensitive details, (2) the “better-than-nothing” consensus tempered by emotional and contextual gaps in AI-generated ADs, (3) the social dynamics of shared viewing, (4) accessibility deserts on new media platforms, and (5) the artistry-precision dilemma. Our findings highlight the need for adaptive, transparent, and user-informed AD systems that balance narrative resonance with efficiency. We conclude with design recommendations for co-designing AI-assisted accessibility tools in partnership with BLV communities.},

Current tools for Blind and Low Vision people (BLV) typically use spoken descriptions but lack support for an enjoyable experience of visually pleasing scenes. We propose a Scene-to-Audio framework that generates comprehensible and enjoyable non-verbal sounds representing distant scenes using generative models informed by psycho-acoustics, audio scene analysis, and Foley sound synthesis. We conducted a user study with eleven BLV participants evaluating strategies to utilize our scene-to-audio framework. We found that these sounds, in combination with speech, provide a significantly more memorable and immersive experience of the scenes, compared to only spoken descriptions. Our work is a step towards bridging the gap between a visual and an auditory experience of a scene, addressing the aesthetic needs of BLVs.},

We address BLV users’ prevalent challenges in accessing effective AD during VR musical performances. Employing a two-phased interview methodology, we initially collected qualitative data about BLV AD users’ experiences, followed by gathering insights from BLV professionals who specialize in AD. This approach ensures that the developed solutions are both user-centric and practically feasible. The study devises strategies for three design concepts of omnidirectional AD (Spatial AD, View-dependent AD, and Explorative AD) tailored to different types of musical performances, which vary in their visual and auditory components. Each design concept offers unique benefits; collectively, they enhance accessibility and enjoyment for BLV audiences by addressing specific user needs. Key insights highlight the crucial role of flexibility and user control in AD implementation. Based on these insights, we propose a comprehensive conceptual framework to enhance musical experiences for BLV users within VR environments.},

However, screen readers do not capture such intention, making it time-consuming and less accessible for blind and visually impaired (BVI) users to linearly consume slides with repeated content. We present Slide Gestalt, an automatic approach that identifies the hierarchical structure in a slide deck. Slide Gestalt computes the visual and textual correspondences between slides to generate hierarchical groupings. Readers can navigate the slide deck from the higher-level section overview to the lower-level description of a slide group or individual elements interactively with our UI. We derived side consumption and authoring practices from interviews with BVI readers and sighted creators and an analysis of 100 decks. We performed our pipeline with 50 real-world slide decks and a large dataset. Feedback from eight BVI participants showed that Slide Gestalt helped navigate a slide deck by anchoring content more efficiently, compared to using accessible slides.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of virtual reality (VR) has led to increased use of social VR platforms for interaction. However, these platforms lack adequate features to support blind and low vision (BLV) users, posing significant challenges in navigation, visual interpretation, and social interaction. One promising approach to these challenges is employing human guides in VR. However, this approach faces limitations with a lack of availability of humans to serve as guides, or the inability to customize the guidance a user receives from the human guide. We introduce an AI-powered guide to address these limitations. The AI guide features six personas, each offering unique behaviors and appearances to meet diverse user needs, along with visual interpretation and navigation assistance. We aim to use this AI guide in the future to help us understand BLV users’ preferences for guide forms and functionalities.},

abstract = {Despite the recent surge of research efforts to make data visualizations accessible to people who are blind or have low vision (BLV), how to support BLV people's data analysis remains an important and challenging question. As refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) become cheaper and conversational agents continue to improve, their combination provides a promising approach to support BLV people's interactive data exploration and analysis. To understand how BLV people would use and react to a system combining an RTD with a conversational agent, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with 11 BLV participants, where they interacted with line charts, bar charts, and isarithmic maps. Our analysis of participants' interactions led to the identification of nine distinct patterns. We also learned that the choice of modalities depended on the type of task and prior experience with tactile graphics, and that participants strongly preferred the combination of RTD and speech to a single modality. In addition, participants with more tactile experience described how tactile images facilitated a deeper engagement with the data and supported independent interpretation. Our findings will inform the design of interfaces for such interactive mixed-modality systems.},

With the development of computer vision technologies, image exploration systems are supporting more fine-grained image content processing, including image segmentation, description and object recognition. However, in developing countries like China, it is still rare for PVI to widely rely on such accessible system. To better understand the usage situation of accessible image exploration system in China and improve the image understanding of PVI in China, we developed AI-Vision, an Android based hierarchical accessible image exploration system supporting the generations of image general description, local object description and metadata information. Our 7-day diary study with 10 PVI verified the usability of AI-Vision and also revealed a series of design implications for improving accessible image exploration systems similar to AI-Vision.},

abstract = {To improve the accessibility of virtual reality (VR) for blind and low-vision (BLV) users, we introduce “scene reading,” a technique inspired by touch-based screen reading for use in virtual environments. Scene reading provides semantic information about virtual objects and their on-screen positions, organizing details into hierarchies that users can navigate for more granular exploration; it also uses spatial audio for nonvisual feedback. To design and evaluate our scene reading technique, we developed a system called SceneVR, which supports touch and gesture input, and spatial audio output. SceneVR streams the live view from a VR headset onto a phone or tablet, letting BLV users drag their finger across the touchscreen to identify objects and avatars, navigate, and gain a spatial understanding of the scene. We conducted a task-based usability study to evaluate our SceneVR controller, collecting data on task performance, user experience, interaction patterns, and subjective feedback. Our findings indicate that scene reading with the SceneVR controller effectively supports BLV users in exploring virtual environments, enabling them to discover objects, navigate object hierarchies, and build an understanding of their surroundings while also providing a sense of enjoyment and agency. However, our findings also reveal initial design implications, including minimizing cognitive load and effectively integrating scene reading labels and descriptions with other sensory feedback to create a cohesive experience.},

However, its visual-centric design poses significant challenges for blind and low vision (BLV) viewers. Our formative study identified three primary challenges that hinder BLV viewers’ engagement with Danmu: the lack of visual context, the speech interference between comments and videos, and the disorganization of comments. To address these challenges, we present DanmuA11y, a system that makes Danmu accessible by transforming it into multi-viewer audio discussions. DanmuA11y incorporates three core features: (1) Augmenting Danmu with visual context, (2) Seamlessly integrating Danmu into videos, and (3) Presenting Danmu via multi-viewer discussions. Evaluation with twelve BLV viewers demonstrated that DanmuA11y significantly improved Danmu comprehension, provided smooth viewing experiences, and fostered social connections among viewers. We further highlight implications for enhancing commentary accessibility in video-based social media and live-streaming platforms.},

abstract={Image spatial composition, information about the number of objects and their characteristics, and additional details such as the colors and attributes of the people in the scene can provide additional information in an image or photograph. However, the usual approaches to make images accessible to blind persons focus mainly on describing the image's content, without inquiring into other aspects such as spatial composition, colors, background, known faces, etc. In doing so, much information that is present in the image but not included in the description is missing for a blind user. This work explores the combination of image captioning and object detection techniques with the final goal of making images more accessible to blind users. The approach is twofold: (1) state-of-the-art algorithms of image captioning and object detection will be combined so blind users can extract different kinds of information from a given image; and (2) blind users will guide the exploration of the images, so they can gather all the information in a personalized manner and make their own interpretation. This novel interaction is designed as a self-guided multi-layered approach, enabling blind users to personalize their exploration of image content by both guiding the process and accessing the different layers of information as desired. We implemented a mobile application based on requirements obtained from blind users and performed an evaluation that provided promising results. The participants were reasonably satisfied with the usability of the prototype, and in general they were able to gather additional information through their tactile exploration that was not present in the initial image descriptions. However, some issues that were detected in the evaluation, and functionalities that could not be implemented, will be addressed in future work.},

This paper presents an AI-driven system that generates multimodal representations---raised tactile graphics and descriptive text---by integrating open-vocabulary object detection (YOLO-World), image segmentation (SAM), edge detection (Canny) and natural language generation (GPT-4o). The goal is to improve image accessibility for BVI students. A user study with four BVI participants in two educational scenarios (animal anatomy and biology scales) showed that the multimodal outputs enhanced understanding and were not seen as overly complex. Participants appreciated the dual-modality approach (average rating: 4.25/5), though one participant noted a need for practice or assistance. These results, although preliminary, highlight the system's potential to make educational images more accessible and underscore the need for personalization and user training.",

New vision-to-language models such as GPT-V, Gemini, and LLaVa can now provide detailed image descriptions on-demand. While prior research and guidelines state that BLV audiences’ information preferences depend on the context of the image, existing tools for accessing vision-to-language models provide only context-free image descriptions by generating descriptions for the image alone without considering the surrounding webpage context. To explore how to integrate image context into image descriptions, we designed a Chrome Extension that automatically extracts webpage context to inform GPT-4V-generated image descriptions. We gained feedback from 12 BLV participants in a user study comparing typical context-free image descriptions to context-aware image descriptions. We then further evaluated our context-informed image descriptions with a technical evaluation. Our user evaluation demonstrates that BLV participants frequently prefer context-aware descriptions to context-free descriptions. BLV participants also rate context-aware descriptions significantly higher in quality, imaginability, relevance, and plausibility. All participants shared that they wanted to use context-aware descriptions in the future and highlighted the potential for use in online shopping, social media, news, and personal interest blogs.},

Multi-layered touch interfaces, on the other hand, can provide rich details and spatial information, but may take longer to explore and cause higher mental load. To understand how BVI users leverage these two methods, we deployed ImageExplorer, an iOS app on the Apple App Store that provides multi-layered image information via both text-based and touch-based interfaces with customizable levels of granularity. Across 12 months, 371 users uploaded 651 images and explored 694 times. Their activities were logged to help us understand how BVI users consume image captions in the wild. This work informs a holistic understanding of BVI users’ image exploration behavior and influential factors. We provide design implications for future models of image captioning and visual access tools.},

In our formative study, 7 BLV viewers who regularly watched short-form videos reported frequently skipping such inaccessible content.

Interactive 3D printed models (I3Ms) have been developed to enable independent learning of 3D models through activating audio labels. However, they present single-layered information and require users to identify interactive elements through a pinpointing action, which might be insufficient for learning complex and unfamiliar subjects. In this paper, we investigate I3Ms for complex structures. We propose TouchPilot, a guidance system designed based on a study that observed learner-explainer interaction styles. TouchPilot guides users step by step through navigation, exploration of hierarchical elements, and confirmation of their entire areas. A follow-up study found that the guidance system led to better learning outcomes and higher independence compared to a pinpointing system. Feedback suggests that being primed by the guidance system systematically, followed by pinpointing freely for review, is preferred for learning complex structures.},

While these tools provide basic accessibility support, it is challenging for blind users to gain collaboration awareness that sighted people can easily obtain using visual cues (e.g., who is editing where and what). Through a series of co-design sessions with a blind coauthor, we identified the current practices and challenges in collaborative editing, and iteratively designed CollabAlly, a system that makes collaboration awareness in document editing accessible to blind users. CollabAlly extracts collaborator, comment, and text-change information and their context from a document and presents them in a dialog box to provide easy access and navigation. CollabAlly uses earcons to communicate background events unobtrusively, voice fonts to differentiate collaborators, and spatial audio to convey the location of document activity. In a study with 11 blind participants, we demonstrate that CollabAlly provides improved access to collaboration awareness by centralizing scattered information, sonifying visual information, and simplifying complex operations.},

While it has experienced a surge in popularity internationally, people with visual impairments cannot enjoy webtoon with the lack of an accessible format. While traditional image description practices can be adopted, resulting descriptions cannot preserve webtoons’ unique values such as control over the reading pace and social engagement through comments. To improve the webtoon reading experience for BLV users, we propose Cocomix, an interactive webtoon reader that leverages comments into the design of novel webtoon interactions. Since comments can identify story highlights and provide additional context, we designed a system that provides 1) comments-based adaptive descriptions with selective access to details and 2) panel-anchored comments for easy access to relevant descriptive comments. Our evaluation (N=12) showed that Cocomix users could adapt the description for various needs and better utilize comments.},

However, the majority of the work focused on photos or graphs. In this study, we propose AccessComics, an accessible digital comic book reader for people with visual impairments. To understand the accessibility of existing platforms, we first conducted a formative online survey with 68 participants who are blind or have low vision asking about their prior experiences with audiobooks and eBooks. Then, to learn the implications of designing an accessible comic book reader for people with visual impairments, we conducted an interview study with eight participants and collected feedback about our system. Considering our findings that a brief description of the scene and sound effects are desired when listening to comic books, we conducted a follow-up study with 16 participants (8 blind, 8 sighted) to explore how to effectively provide scene descriptions and sound effects, generated based on the onomatopoeia and mimetic words that appear in comics. Then we assessed the impact of the overall reading experience and if it differs depending on the user group. The results show that the presence of scene descriptions was perceived to be useful for concentration and understanding the situation, while the sound effects were perceived to make the book-reading experience more immersive and realistic. Based on the findings, we suggest design implications specifying features that future accessible comic book readers should support.},

  abstract={Natural language descriptions sometimes accompany visualizations to better communicate and contextualize their insights, and to improve their accessibility for readers with disabilities. However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our work further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface coequal with visualization.},

    abstract = {Biomedical visualizations are key to accessing biomedical knowledge and detecting new patterns in large datasets. Interactive visualizations are essential for biomedical data scientists and are omnipresent in data analysis software and data portals. Without appropriate descriptions, these visualizations are not accessible to all people with blindness and low vision, who often rely on screen reader accessibility technologies to access visual information on digital devices. Screen readers require descriptions to convey image content. However, many images lack informative descriptions due to unawareness and difficulty writing such descriptions. Describing complex and interactive visualizations, like genomics data visualizations, is even more challenging. Automatic generation of descriptions could be beneficial, yet current alt text generating models are limited to basic visualizations and cannot be used for genomics.We present AltGosling, an automated description generation tool focused on interactive data visualizations of genome-mapped data, created with the grammar-based genomics toolkit Gosling. The logic-based algorithm of AltGosling creates various descriptions including a tree-structured navigable panel. We co-designed AltGosling with a blind screen reader user (co-author). We show that AltGosling outperforms state-of-the-art large language models and common image-based neural networks for alt text generation of genomics data visualizations. As a first of its kind in genomic research, we lay the groundwork to increase accessibility in the field.The source code, examples, and interactive demo are accessible under the MIT License at https://github.com/gosling-lang/altgosling.

abstract="Current laws and directives such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the European Union's Directive 2016/2102 aim to support people with disabilities. At the same time, they also represent a challenge for many website owners who have to comply with these legal requirements. Providers of so-called overlay tools offer, among other things, fully automated solutions which, according to their own statements, can be installed within a few minutes and subsequently improve the website in such a way that it is accessible and compliant with the laws and standards. This raises two questions. First, to what extent overlay tools provide real accessibility improvements? And second, is it possible to identify possibilities and limitations and therefore suggest potential improvements. Based on a comparison of the features of nine existing tools, three were selected for closer examination (accessiBe, EqualWeb and UserWay). In addition, a comparative study of these providers was conducted. For this purpose, a total of seven metrics were defined, which are based on the information and promises of the providers as well as on the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1. To validate the changes made by the overlay tools, the adaptations were evaluated using 29 of the 92 test steps of the BIK BITV-Test. Moreover, the site owner's perspective was taken into account and the corresponding features and functions were analyzed and evaluated within four metrics. However, user tests are not part of this work. Significant differences between the overlay tools can be seen primarily in the adjustments to the actual website. In comparison, accessiBe corrects more failures and barriers for blind users and users who use the keyboard navigation and thus also achieves the best result in the overall score. Despite these improvements, full compliance is clearly not possible. However, both theoretical and concrete opportunities for improvement were identified.",

abstract = {Customization is crucial for making visualizations accessible to blind and low-vision (BLV) people with widely-varying needs. But what makes for usable or useful customization? We identify four design goals for how BLV people should be able to customize screen-reader-accessible visualizations: presence, or what content is included; verbosity, or how concisely content is presented; ordering, or how content is sequenced; and, duration, or how long customizations are active. To meet these goals, we model a customization as a sequence of content tokens, each with a set of adjustable properties. We instantiate our model by extending Olli, an open-source accessible visualization toolkit, with a settings menu and command box for persistent and ephemeral customization respectively. Through a study with 13 BLV participants, we find that customization increases the ease of identifying and remembering information. However, customization also introduces additional complexity, making it more helpful for users familiar with similar tools.},

We employed an iterative, user-centered design process with 25 PVIs to design and evaluate GuardLens, a browser extension that improves the accessibility of privacy/security cues and helps PVIs assess a website's legitimacy (i.e., if it is a spoof/phish). We started with a formative study to understand what privacy/ security cues PVIs find helpful, and then improved GuardLens based on the results. Next, we further refined Guardlens based on a pilot study, and lastly, conducted our main study to evaluate GuardLens' efficacy. The results suggest that GuardLens, by extracting and listing pertinent privacy/ security cues in one place for faster and easier access, helps PVIs quickly and accurately determine if websites are legitimate or spoofs. PVIs found cues such as domain age, search result ranking, and the presence/absence of HTTPS encryption especially helpful. We conclude with design implications for tools to support PVIs with safe web browsing.},

abstract = {Web accessibility is essential for ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, can access and effectively use the internet. This principle is fundamental as digital platforms increasingly become primary channels for education, communication, commerce, and entertainment. Our study critically evaluates the effectiveness of accessibility overlays, which are third-party tools that claim to enhance website usability for people with disabilities. Specifically, we focused on the experiences of blind and low-vision users, who are disproportionately impacted by poor web accessibility. Through a combination of online surveys and interviews, we engaged with participants who employ a variety of assistive technologies to navigate the web. The empirical evidence gathered paints a troubling picture: despite their intended purpose, accessibility overlays often fail to deliver on their promises and, in many cases, increase existing challenges. Participants frequently reported that these overlays conflicted with their assistive technologies, leading to reduced functionality and increased frustration. This points to a significant misalignment between the design of these tools and the real-world needs of users. The study highlights the pressing need to move away from superficial technological fixes and towards deeper, more meaningful engagement with the needs of disabled users. This involves embracing user-centered design practices that integrate accessibility considerations from the ground up, ensuring that digital environments are truly inclusive. By prioritizing comprehensive, well-integrated solutions over patches like overlays, we can foster a more accessible and equitable digital landscape.},

abstract = {Online shopping is becoming ubiquitous in everyday life, with shopping experiences primarily delivered through either websites or specialized applications. This format may create inclusivity problems for users with different needs, as not all websites or applications are optimized for accessibility or have multiple alternative forms of interaction with the content. This can be especially challenging in customer-to-customer (C2C) platforms. While in online shopping a single platform can make merchants provide a unified display for description, standardized packaging, and ensure the item quality, in C2C platforms this responsibility falls mostly on users, thus creating a need for a more versatile way of processing, display, and interaction with C2C content. We are interested in how this issue can be alleviated through addition of online assistants that support immersive and multimodal forms of interactions. To gain a better understanding of the problem and needs of users, we have built a prototype application that uses a voice-activated assistant for item search and purchase and evaluated it in a pilot study. The findings suggest that participants value efficiency in C2C shopping and find current platforms problematic, while showing interest in voice search, immersive and multimodal interfaces to improve the overall shopping experience, despite some issues with voice recognition and response time.},

From government reports to bank statements, tables effectively carry essential data-driven information by visually organizing data using rows, columns, and other arrangements (e.g., merged cells). However, many tables online neglect the accessibility requirements for people who rely on screen readers, such as people who are blind or have low vision (BLV). First, we consolidated guidelines to understand what makes a table inaccessible for BLV people. We conducted an interview study to understand the importance of tables and identify further design requirements for an accessible table. We built a tool that automatically detects HTML formatted tables online and transforms them into accessible tables. Our evaluative study demonstrates how our tool can help participants understand the table’s structure and layout and support smooth navigation when the table is large and complex.},

abstract = {Modern web interfaces are unnecessarily complex to use as they overwhelm users with excess text and visuals unrelated to their current goals. Such interfaces can particularly impact screen reader users (SRUs), who may need to navigate content sequentially and thus spend minutes traversing irrelevant elements compared to vision users (VUs) who visually skim in seconds. We present Task Mode, a system that dynamically filters web content based on user-specified goals using large language models to identify and prioritize relevant elements while minimizing distractions. Our approach preserves page structure while offering multiple viewing modes tailored to different access needs. Our user study with 12 participants (6 VUs, 6 SRUs) demonstrates that our approach halved task completion time for SRUs while maintaining performance for VUs, decreasing the completion time gap between groups from 2x to 1.2x. 11 of 12 participants wanted to use Task Mode in the future, reporting that Task Mode supported completing tasks with less effort and fewer distractions. This work demonstrates how designing new interactions simultaneously for visual and non-visual access can reduce rather than reinforce accessibility disparities in future technology created by researchers and practitioners.},

They have achieved phenomenal success across a broad spectrum of applications in numerous industries, transforming how we interact with the digital world. Notwithstanding these remarkable successes, applying LLMs within the realm of accessibility has largely been unexplored. We introduce&nbsp;Savant, as a demonstration of the potential of LLMs for accessibility. Specifically,&nbsp;Savant leverages the impressive text comprehension abilities of LLMs to provide uniform interaction for screen reader users across various applications, mitigating the significant interaction burden imposed by the heterogeneity in user interfaces for blind screen reader users.&nbsp;Savant automates screen reader actions on control elements like buttons, text fields, and drop-down menus via spoken natural language commands (NLCs). Interpreting the NLC, identifying the correct control element, and formulating the action sequence are facilitated by LLMs. Few-shot prompts supply context and guidance for the LLMs to produce appropriate responses, specifically converting the NLC into a correct series of actions on the user interface elements, which are then performed automatically. The demonstration will exhibit&nbsp;Savant’s capability across a variety of exemplar applications, emphasizing its versatility.},

However, when such navigation aids are unavailable or not appropriately marked up, this situation can cause serious difficulties. This article presents the design and evaluation of a tool for automatically generating navigation aids with headers and internal links for screen readers with topicalisation and labelling algorithms. The proposed tool uses natural language processing techniques to divide a web document into topic segments and label each segment in two cycles based on its content. We conducted an initial user study in the first cycle with eight blind and partially-sighted screen reader users. The evaluation involved tasks with questions answered by participants with information from texts with and without automatically generated headers. The results in the first cycle provided preliminary indicators of performance improvement and cognitive load reduction. The second cycle involved co-designing an improved version with two blind experts in web accessibility, resulting in a browser extension which injects automatically generated headers and in-page navigation with internal links, along with improvements in the generation of labels using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The browser extension was evaluated by seven blind participants using the same four texts used to evaluate the preliminary prototype developed in the first cycle. With the two development cycles, the study provided important insights into the design of navigation aids for screen-reader users using natural language processing techniques, including the potential use of generative artificial intelligence for assistive technologies and limitations that need to be explored in future research.},

This is an attempt to make the famous Blockly library accessible through a screen reader and keyboard. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Accessible Blockly. We also discuss the evaluation of the library for block-based code navigation in a study with 12 blind programmers. Analysis of the study results shows that Accessible Blockly effectively aids users with reading and understanding block-based code. Participants found Accessible Blockly easy to use and less frustrating for navigating block-based programs. The participants also expressed enthusiasm and interest in using the keyboard and screen reader to navigate block-based code and in the accessibility of block-based programming.},

abstract = {In a world driven by data visualization, ensuring the inclusive accessibility of charts for Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) individuals remains a significant challenge. Charts are usually presented as raster graphics without textual and visual metadata needed for an equivalent exploration experience for BVI people. Additionally, converting these charts into accessible formats requires considerable effort from sighted individuals. Digitizing charts with metadata extraction is just one aspect of the issue; transforming it into accessible modalities, such as tactile graphics, presents another difficulty. To address these disparities, we propose Chart4Blind, an intelligent user interface that converts bitmap image representations of line charts into universally accessible formats. Chart4Blind achieves this transformation by generating Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Comma-Separated Values (CSV), and alternative text exports, all comply with established accessibility standards. Through interviews and a formal user study, we demonstrate that even inexperienced sighted users can make charts accessible in an average of 4 minutes using Chart4Blind, achieving a System Usability Scale rating of 90\%. In comparison to existing approaches, Chart4Blind provides a comprehensive solution, generating end-to-end accessible SVGs suitable for assistive technologies such as embossed prints (papers and laser cut), 2D tactile displays, and screen readers.

abstract = {Web-based data visualizations have become very popular for exploring data and communicating insights. Newspapers, journals, and reports regularly publish visualizations to tell compelling stories with data. Unfortunately, most visualizations are inaccessible to readers with visual impairments. For many charts on the web, there are no accompanying alternative (alt) texts, and even if such texts exist they do not adequately describe important insights from charts. To address the problem, we first interviewed 15 blind users to understand their challenges and requirements for reading data visualizations. Based on the insights from these interviews, we developed SeeChart, an interactive tool that automatically deconstructs charts from web pages and then converts them to accessible visualizations for blind people by enabling them to hear the chart summary as well as to interact through data points using the keyboard. Our evaluation with 14 blind participants suggests the efficacy of SeeChart in understanding key insights from charts and fulfilling their information needs while reducing their required time and cognitive burden.},

abstract = {Dashboards are frequently used to monitor and share data across a breadth of domains including business, finance, sports, public policy, and healthcare, just to name a few. The combination of different components (e.g., key performance indicators, charts, filtering widgets) and the interactivity between components makes dashboards powerful interfaces for data monitoring and analysis. However, these very characteristics also often make dashboards inaccessible to blind and low vision (BLV) users. Through a co-design study with two screen reader users, we investigate challenges faced by BLV users and identify design goals to support effective screen reader-based interactions with dashboards. Operationalizing the findings from the co-design process, we present a prototype system, Azimuth, that generates dashboards optimized for screen reader-based navigation along with complementary descriptions to support dashboard comprehension and interaction. Based on a follow-up study with five BLV participants, we showcase how our generated dashboards support BLV users and enable them to perform both targeted and open-ended analysis. Reflecting on our design process and study feedback, we discuss opportunities for future work on supporting interactive data analysis, understanding dashboard accessibility at scale, and investigating alternative devices and modalities for designing accessible visualization dashboards.},

  abstract = { Visually impaired individuals, estimated at 285 million globally, rely heavily on-screen readers for internet access. However, much of the visually available information, such as the relationship between webpage elements, does not translate well to its textual representation and must be always kept in memory, limiting contextual interactions. To address this challenge, we developed Touch Matrix Assistive Technology Navigator (TOMAT), an open-source system that works alongside screen readers to provide an interactive, audio-tactile representation of webpage structure and enable contextual interactions. Our study employed a participatory design approach, involving visually impaired users, healthcare professionals, engineers, and community organizations in co-design sessions, prototype demonstrations, and focus groups. The resulting system extracts and presents non-linear web information at multiple levels of detail, allowing users to dynamically adjust granularity and efficiently navigate and interact with web content. Participants reported that TOMAT enhanced their understanding of webpage structure and provided an intuitive complement to screen reader software. The findings suggest TOMAT has the potential to improve the internet navigation experience for visually impaired users, fostering greater independence and digital participation. To support further development and collaboration, TOMAT’s source files have been released under an open-source license. }

While ads are typically designed for visual consumption, it is unclear how they affect blind users who interact with the ads using a screen reader. Existing research studies on non-visual web interaction predominantly focus on general web browsing; the specific impact of extraneous ad content on blind users’ experience remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted an interview study with 18 blind participants; we found that blind users are often deceived by ads that contextually blend in with the surrounding web page content. While ad blockers can address this problem via a blanket filtering operation, many websites are increasingly denying access if an ad blocker is active. Moreover, ad blockers often do not filter out internal ads injected by the websites themselves. Therefore, we devised an algorithm to automatically identify contextually deceptive ads on a web page. Specifically, we built a detection model that leverages a multi-modal combination of handcrafted and automatically extracted features to determine if a particular ad is contextually deceptive. Evaluations of the model on a representative test dataset and ‘in-the-wild’ random websites yielded F1 scores of 0.86 and 0.88, respectively.},

abstract = {For many blind users, interaction with computer applications using screen reader assistive technology is a frustrating and time-consuming affair, mostly due to the complexity and heterogeneity of applications’ user interfaces. An interview study revealed that many applications do not adequately convey their interface structure and controls to blind screen reader users, thereby placing additional burden on these users to acquire this knowledge on their own. This is often an arduous and tedious learning process given the one-dimensional navigation paradigm of screen readers. Moreover, blind users have to repeat this learning process multiple times, i.e., once for each application, since applications differ in their interface designs and implementations. In this paper, we propose a novel push-based approach to make non-visual computer interaction easy, efficient, and uniform across different applications. The key idea is to make screen reader interaction ‘structure-agnostic’, by automatically identifying and extracting all application controls and then instantly ‘pushing’ these controls on demand to the blind user via a custom overlay dashboard interface. Such a custom overlay facilitates uniform and efficient screen reader navigation across all applications. A user study showed significant improvement in user satisfaction and interaction efficiency with our approach compared to a state-of-the-art screen reader.},

abstract = {Modern web interfaces are unnecessarily complex to use as they overwhelm users with excess text and visuals unrelated to their current goals. Such interfaces can particularly impact screen reader users (SRUs), who may need to navigate content sequentially and thus spend minutes traversing irrelevant elements compared to vision users (VUs) who visually skim in seconds. We present Task Mode, a system that dynamically filters web content based on user-specified goals using large language models to identify and prioritize relevant elements while minimizing distractions. Our approach preserves page structure while offering multiple viewing modes tailored to different access needs. Our user study with 12 participants (6 VUs, 6 SRUs) demonstrates that our approach halved task completion time for SRUs while maintaining performance for VUs, decreasing the completion time gap between groups from 2x to 1.2x. 11 of 12 participants wanted to use Task Mode in the future, reporting that Task Mode supported completing tasks with less effort and fewer distractions. This work demonstrates how designing new interactions simultaneously for visual and non-visual access can reduce rather than reinforce accessibility disparities in future technology created by researchers and practitioners.},

  abstract={Visually impaired users still face fundamental obstacles when interacting with complex, dynamic websites. Conventional screen readers expose pages in a strict linear order, offer little semantic context for visual media, and provide limited context regarding the page content. This paper introduces a multi-modal accessibility framework combining Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision, and dynamic DOM manipulation to significantly enhance semantic clarity, non-linear navigation, and interaction richness. By interpreting visual and textual web content contextually and adapting it into an intuitive, conversationally navigable interface, our method provides a foundation for visually impaired users to interact effectively with previously inaccessible or challenging digital experiences.The deployment of a functional prototype on a modern web browser illustrates the capability of the proposed system to interact with diverse websites and tasks. The research team selected Canada’s most frequented websites to assess the system’s efficacy in enhancing contextual understanding of the page content and enabling navigation through pages and actions via a chat-driven interface. A comprehensive demonstration was executed using a prominent ticketing site, which facilitated users in obtaining a deeper understanding of the page while guiding them towards the successful purchase of concert tickets. By illustrating how vision language and LLM reasoning can be coupled with low-level browser control, this work lays the groundwork for future efforts in performance optimization, large-scale evaluation, and personalization across diverse web contexts.},

This article presents a novel edge-IoT-based framework that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), multi-object tracking, and scene understanding to develop real-time, responsive assistance for impaired individuals. Our proposed system is designed to enhance accessibility and quality of life by providing educational tools and entertainment options that cater specifically to the needs of this community. The proposed solution leverages the computational power of edge devices to process data locally, ensuring low latency and high responsiveness, which are critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, we explore the potential of generative AI models in improving autonomy, with a particular focus on real-time transcription services for the hearing impaired and scene description services for the visually impaired. This work demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using edge-IoT technologies combined with advanced AI techniques to create inclusive environments that empower disabled individuals, ensuring that technological advancements are leveraged to foster accessibility and independence.},

abstract = {Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide new opportunities for blind and low vision (BLV) people to access visual information in their daily lives. However, these models often produce errors that are difficult to detect without sight, posing safety and social risks in scenarios from medication identification to outfit selection. While BLV MLLM users use creative workarounds such as cross-checking between tools and consulting sighted individuals, these approaches are often time-consuming and impractical. We explore how systematically surfacing variations across multiple MLLM responses can support BLV users to detect unreliable information without visually inspecting the image. We contribute a design space for eliciting and presenting variations in MLLM descriptions, a prototype system implementing three variation presentation styles, and findings from a user study with 15 BLV participants. Our results demonstrate that presenting variations significantly increases users’ ability to identify unreliable claims (by 4.9x using our approach compared to single descriptions) and significantly decreases perceived reliability of MLLM responses. 14 of 15 participants preferred seeing variations of MLLM responses over a single description, and all expressed interest in using our system for tasks from understanding a tornado’s path to posting an image on social media.},

As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

Blind users can design a web page layout through creating and editing web elements by snapping or adjusting tangible brackets on top of the baseboard. The baseboard senses the brackets’ type, size, and location, verbalizes the information, and renders the web page on the client browser.

Recent research uncovered perceived algorithmic biases suppressing the content created by marginalized populations (e.g., people of color, the LGBT+ community, and content creators of lower socioeconomic status). However, little is known about how BLV streamers, as a marginalized population, perceive the effects of the algorithms adopted by live streaming platforms. We interviewed BLV streamers (N=19) of Douyin — a popular live stream platform in China — to understand their perceptions of algorithms, perceived challenges, and mitigation strategies. Our findings show the perceived factors contributing to disadvantages under algorithmic evaluation of BLV streamers’ content (e.g., issues with filming and timely interaction with viewers) and perceived algorithmic suppression (e.g., content not amplified to sighted users but suppressed within the BLV community). Their mitigation strategies (e.g., not watching other BLV streamers’ shows) tended to be passive. We discuss design considerations to design a more inclusive and fair live streaming platform.},

abstract = {As blind and low-vision (BLV) players engage more deeply with games, accessibility features have become essential. While some research has explored tools and strategies to enhance game accessibility, the specific experiences of these players with mobile games remain underexamined. This study addresses this gap by investigating how BLV users experience mobile games with varying accessibility levels. Through interviews with 32 experienced BLV mobile players, we explore their perceptions, challenges, and strategies for engaging with mobile games. Our findings reveal that BLV players turn to mobile games to alleviate boredom, achieve a sense of accomplishment, and build social connections, but face barriers depending on the game’s accessibility level. We also compare mobile games to other forms of gaming, highlighting the relative advantages of mobile games, such as the inherent accessibility of smartphones. This study contributes to understanding BLV mobile gaming experiences and provides insights for enhancing accessible mobile game design.},

abstract = {Blind and low-vision (BLV) learners encounter significant barriers in accessing STEM content, as traditional accommodations, such as braille transcription and tactile graphics, are time-consuming and labor-intensive, often resulting in delays that impede timely engagement with STEM content. Responding to this accessibility gap, we present StemA11y, an AI-powered iOS application that automatically converts STEM materials into accessible formats and delivers them via speech, audio cues, haptics, and VoiceOver support. We evaluated StemA11y with 11 BLV participants across two content types–math worksheets and adapted SAT papers. Our results revealed that System Usability Scale (SUS) scores exceeded the industry benchmark of 68 for both math worksheets (M = 75.2) and SAT papers (M = 83.2). Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) ratings indicated high perceived ease of use, ease of learning, and overall satisfaction. Further, qualitative feedback demonstrated the importance of customizable content verbosity and flexible navigation. Drawing on these insights, we reconsider STEM accessibility for BLV learners and discuss design considerations for developing multisensory AI-powered mobile systems to improve STEM accessibility, including customizable content verbosity, strategies to reduce redundant audio cues, and enhanced support for flexible navigation.},
