Quote:
We acknowledge that there are diverse preferences among disability communities
regarding the use of person-frst or identity-frst language [34]. In this paper, we
use identity-frst language (e.g., blind and low-vision people) instead of person-frst
language (e.g., people who are blind; people with vision loss or visual impairments),
guided by the perspective of the National Federation of the Blind. 2The term "non-BLV" is used in this paper instead of "sighted" to better describe
individuals who are neither blind nor low-vision, as BLV individuals may have partial
sight in the visualization context. "Sighted" is used only when directly quoted from
study participants.
