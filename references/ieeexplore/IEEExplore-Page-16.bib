  abstract={Visual impairment is a global problem and people without vision suffer more than other impaired people. A companion is always needed for the movement of blind people and there may not be anyone by their side in case of emergency. Walking alone on the street, detecting the person closest to him and avoiding obstacles are always problems. Researchers have been working for visually impaired people using sensor based distance measurement systems for years. This paper proposes a Computer Vision based system to navigate visually impaired people by using Artificial Intelligence, and also a novel distance measuring approach. The system will capture real time images through a camera placed inside a sun-glass then process the video frames by trained YOLO V3 model. After processing, the program will identify a total of 80 pre-trained objects and additional 7 objects including person, car, bicycle, and broken roads and then will produce a navigation command through headphones. A comparative evaluation with other similar works is performed, and the result represents the primary accomplishments of this article. Several testing and validation procedures were carried out in order to achieve optimal performance and accurate distance measurement. The proposed system outperforms the state-ofthe-art in terms of object detection, distance measurement, computational costs calculation, and accessibility for the visually impaired, according to the results, which were validated using mathematical calculations and the necessary measuring devices. Since Industry 4.0 demands smart automation, this system has a significant impact not just on disabled persons but also on the development of a smart city.},

  abstract={Novelty detection in open worlds is a valuable endeavor for improving the robustness of autonomous systems. Open worlds are characterized by a lack of constraints on the types of novelties that might occur. Here we describe recent progress on detecting novelties in open-world numerical properties in our OpenMIND agent, a domain-independent planning-based AI architecture. Our approach has three elements: (1) Feature construction by crossing a tractable number of domain-dependent sensors with some basic domainindependent statistical derivations, (2) online, univariate changepoint detection on each signal, and (3) negative feature selection by screening for false positives in non-novel scenarios. We report on the effectiveness of this approach in a single-blind evaluation in which OpenMIND plays a game and encounters novelties never observed by it or its developers.},

  abstract={As a tool of information dissemination, Internet not only provides abundant information, but also brings serious information overload. Recommendation algorithm can extract interests and preferences from users' historical information, so as to make personalized information recommendation to users, which has been widely used in various scenarios in the Internet field. With the development of artificial intelligence, especially the application of machine learning, recommendation algorithm has developed into a multidisciplinary research direction of integrating neural networks, knowledge graphs and natural language processing. In order to alleviate the problem of “information cocoon” caused by blind pursuit of recommendation accuracy, this paper mainly proposes a fuzzy algorithm recommendation model with dynamic threshold based on machine learning model. By improving association rules, the data imbalance in the data set is adjusted, the speed of data processing is improved, and the dynamic threshold adjustment strategy is adopted to provide personalized information services to users accurately.},

  abstract={The Vision Vanguard project offers a cutting-edge CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) driven solution designed to strengthen the ranks of the visually disabled population. Using state-of-the-art image recognition techniques and instantaneous feedback, Vision Vanguard seeks to transform the everyday lives of those who are visually disabled, by giving them access to a dependable and user-friendly navigation and object recognition tool. The project intends to use artificial intelligence to help those with disabilities such as the blind or visually disabled perceive their environment. The CNN model is built with cutting-edge computer vision techniques and trained on a wide range of datasets with different environmental circumstances. Through the processing of input from a live video stream, the model produces written descriptions or aural feedback about its environment through an interface which maybe utilised by those with vision impairments. The study describes the CNN model's architecture and training process and goes over its performance measures, which include accuracy, precision, and recall. It also emphasizes the model's usefulness in various environmental settings and its capacity for real-time inference. The model is built using deep learning techniques and trained on a large and diverse dataset that encompasses both outdoor and indoor scenarios. Strict optimization and validation were used in the training process to achieve the ideal balance between accuracy and efficiency. The model's dependability and efficiency in identifying and categorizing objects, barriers, and contextual data are extensively tested and illustrated using performance measures including accuracy and precision. The research also explores the CNN model's real-time inference capabilities, showing how quickly it can digest visual input and provide textual explanations or aural feedback through an intuitive interface.

  abstract={Object detection is an important system, especially in situations where there is a significant potential of accidents, such as on a railway track. To avoid future collisions, the system must recognize and track each object passing through the monitored region with high accuracy, and this procedure must be completed in real time. This system leverages the latest artificial intelligence advancements, incorporating YOLOv5 for detection. The prototype uses a camera that obtains a panoramic view spanning about 2 km of the track. This image is then shown in real-time on a tiny screen located in the locomotive pilot cabin. An integrated radar sensor system is used to continually identify obstructions in the blind areas of the train operator, covering short, mid, and long distances. This technology is specifically designed to aid in avoiding collisions at high speeds. Employing the OpenCV library, the study employs two distinct approaches: the first utilizes Haar Cascade Classifiers, a straightforward yet effective method for object detection, particularly well-suited for person recognition. The second approach harnesses the capabilities of the Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSMD), a state-of-the-art technique known for its real-time object detection prowess, combining high accuracy and speed. By integrating these two approaches, the paper proposes a comprehensive strategy for object detection in railway track. It also detect the signal in foggy condition. A high-speed graphics processing unit (GPU) has been used for efficient parallel computing, specifically designed for real-time operations, to enhance the speed of real-time tasks.},

  abstract={The novel Surveillance Camera-Based Fire Detection System maximizes the utilization of the existing surveillance infrastructure. Using state-of-the-art computer vision and AI algorithms, it can instantly identify flames, smoke, and other fire-related phenomena in real-time video feeds from strategically placed security cameras. By merging information from several cameras, it decreases blind spots and raises the possibility of early detection. When a fire event is identified, it immediately alerts both nearby monitoring centers and staff who are on-site, providing vital details about the location and seriousness of the situation. Technology advances quickly, adapts to various environments, and integrates with fire suppression systems to trigger automatic responses. For post-incident analysis and hazard prediction based on historical trends, it also retains historical.

  pages={0426-0430},
  abstract={Pedestrian safety is a topic that has been tackled by many researchers in the past using machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches. One of the main reasons for this is the development of self-driving vehicles, which would require systems to detect pedestrians to ensure their safety. Many approaches utilize onboard camera systems which work great for most situations but there are certain shortcomings to this approach. One case is with blind right turns where the onboard cameras cannot see the entire crosswalk due to obstruction of a parked vehicle or building close to the corner. An alternative approach is to use cameras that already exist at intersections to create a warning system that detects pedestrians at each crosswalk. There are many methods of implementation, such as integration with self-driving vehicles using a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) approach or using a caution light to warn drivers in advance. This paper will discuss approaches and considerations for using object detection for intersection safety using cameras at intersections. Results using different pre-trained YOLOv8 models provided by Ultralytics for three different intersection datasets from Urban Tracker: Multiple Object Tracking in Urban Mixed Traffic show that the YOLOv8 pre-trained models perform extremely well for this task.},

  abstract={In this paper, the foremost goal is to create an assistive communication device for people with disabilities such as visually impaired, hearing impaired, speech impaired, and even non-walkable people. The kit is multifunctional and integrates advanced OpenCV technology, along with Braille input/output systems, and various components such as LCD screens, speakers, and machines with Computer Vision capabilities. This device allows users to communicate effectively and complete daily activities regardless of their different imbalances. Blind users can interact with the system using the Braille input and output devices. They can also hear the outputs from the audio speaker or see it on the LCD screen. For the speech impaired, sign languages are recognized and converted to speech using a speaker. Deaf people can receive audio signals or Braille inputs and see the information on the LCD or through the Braille output device. With the toggle switch, we can easily choose the mode which allows all sorts of disabilities to work towards making the world a better place. This multi-purpose device was built with an Arduino Mega to easily adapt the platform and integrate everything to fill in the communication gap and motivate people with different disabilities to engage with everyone in society regardless of their ability. This project is a step toward creating a more inclusive society by harnessing the power of AI, computer vision, and embedded technology.

  abstract={Electronic products have been evolving towards high performance and high integration to meet the demands of high-performance computing, next-generation mobile communication, artificial intelligence, automotive electronics, and defense equipment. In order to achieve the highest wiring density and optimize electrical performance, flip-chip ball grid array (FCBGA) substrates are developed, utilizing multiple high-density wiring layers, laser blind vias, buried vias, and stacked vias, along with ultra-fine pitch metallization. Currently, FCBGA packaging is widely used in high-performance processors, graphics processors, network chips, communication devices, and consumer electronics. With the increase of integration level, the quality and reliability of FCBGA packaging have been highly concerned. FCBGA packaging substrates typically employ build-up films as the interlayer insulation material. The breakdown strength performance of build-up films under high-temperature and high-humidity environments is crucial to their reliable operation. Recent studies have made significant strides in elucidating breakdown strength mechanisms. However, despite these research efforts, breakdown strength research still faces formidable challenges. For instance, the complexity of breakdown mechanisms, especially in high-energy, high-frequency, and complex environments remain controversial. The intricate relation between material properties, environmental factors, and electric field characteristics complicates the understanding of breakdown variation of build-up films. This study simulated real operating conditions by subjecting samples to different conditions, comparing the trend of breakdown strength performance changes of build-up films after biased highly accelerated stress tests (BHAST). It was found that moisture ingress was the most significant factors damaging the insulation performance of build-up films, leading to the decrease in breakdown strength. When the moisture content in the build-up films increased from 0.05% to 0.49%, the breakdown strength decreased from 332 kV/mm to 250 kV/mm.},

  abstract={With the progress of science and technology and artificial intelligence, path planning and optimal path solving have gradually become hot topics. Considering the frequent deadlock problem of ant colony algorithm in path planning problem, and the long running time and low computational efficiency of ant colony algorithm. The research of node ant colony technology is based on Darwin's theory of evolution. To begin, based on the previous research on ant colony algorithm and the model learning of path search, a simple ant colony algorithm model is proposed to deal with the blind search problem in the blank grid. When the goal influence factor and the barrier impact factor are combined into the heuristic function, the global search capabilities increase and impasse is averted. The next phase is to use Darwin's theory of evolution to improve the pheromone workup of the ant colonies algorithm in order to speed up and lower the predicted time cost. Experiments on raster maps of various sizes show that the evolutionary ant colony technique suggested in this study boosts iteration speed, improves search efficiency, finds the best path, and avoids stalemate.},

  abstract={Today, sharing personal information online is common as it helps to social connectivity and strengthen the user experience, but it also presents great privacy dangers. This paper reviews factors that influence users' privacy attitudes towards information disclosure. Recent studies of privacy behaviours are reviewed to highlight key elements that shape their outcomes, including perceived risks and benefits, data collectors trust, social norms, and control over shared data. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) provides a relationship from relaxed privacy attitudes to greater information dissemination especially on the social networking sites. Results show that people are more willing to share when they see lower risk and more control. The paper also talks about ‘privacy fatigue’ or users feeling overloaded by privacy issues and turning a blind eye to online situations. Study limitations are that the study is limited to user perspective and future research involving social and familial influences is suggested. Finally, this review highlights the necessity for the development of adaptive privacy policies to accommodate emerging technologies (e.g., AI, IoT) which bring on new privacy issues.},

This paper proposes an unsupervised algorithm capable of rapidly and effectively detecting the key of symbolic music, while also addressing any instances of modulation or tonic deviation. We evaluate the method on diverse samples, both with and without modulation, across multiple musical styles. Comparative analysis with established algorithms demonstrates its promising performance.},

  abstract={Road safety is a prime concern in this era of high speed and automated driving vehicles. Lot of lives are lost or injured every day due to road accidents. Just understanding where the roads are is not adequate for an autonomous vehicle, obstacles like other vehicles and even less impact-resistant pedestrians and cyclists should be identified and avoided. Moreover, a technology proposed should also be capable to augment itself to provide other applications in the related fields. The proposed method here recognizes and report to the system about the objects such as cars, pedestrians, animals, etc. Once the object is identified, the next time vehicle approaches the similar object, it notifies the driver. And it also tells the system whether the object is moving towards or away from our vehicle. Augmenting this algorithm in applications like that of self-driven vehicle or automobiles/devices using Artificial Intelligence for the blind can be made for better safety. The system developed will be subjected to trials in the real life and correlated with an experimental setup.},

  abstract={With the continuous upgrading of communication networks and the development of artificial intelligence technology, improving the performance of communication networks by realizing their intelligence is a widely researched direction. For example, reinforcement learning is utilized for time-sensitive network (TSN) configuration to enhance its adaptability to dynamic environments. However, the training of DRL algorithms suffers from a time-consuming problem, which runs counter to the delay sensitivity of communication networks. Therefore, we utilize network prediction algorithms to assist reinforcement learning by proposing an improved DRL algorithm, called preDQN, which will be used to help agents explore the environment more efficiently and reduce the time they spend in the training process compared to the agent's blind exploration behavior in the DRL algorithm. Experimental validation has been carried out in a simulation environment and the experimental results show that the improved reinforcement learning algorithm preDQN can significantly improve its convergence.},

  abstract={Motor imagery-based BCI plays a vital role in controlling hand movements by processing and recognizing features from EEG signals associated with the imagination of those movements. In this paper, we present a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) based framework in order to classify the left and right-hand movements along with the absence of movement's intention from the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. The emergence of KAN is expected to be a breakthrough concept in the artificial intelligence paradigm considering its learnable activation functions mechanism and interpretability opportunities. Preprocessing of the collected raw EEG data has been accomplished with band-pass filtering of EEG components of five well-matched channels and corresponding power spectral density feature extraction. We have used 15282 samples with annotated classes from a publicly available dataset to train, validate, and test the classifier. A comparative analysis of the performance of KAN and conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) networks has been conducted in order to investigate the effectiveness of the KAN for this classification task. The proposed framework attains 96.14% classification accuracy for 3057 blind test samples, which is found to be better than the conventional MLP neural network approach (76.64% accuracy) and compatible with the existing techniques. The finding of this research might be useful in hand movement-related applications for robotics, prosthetics, and neuro-rehabilitation supports.},

  abstract={Convolutional neural network combines low-level features to form more abstract high-level representation attribute categories or features, so as to discover the distributed feature representation of data. At the same time, convolutional neural network is also a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence and big data analysis in recent years. However, the convolutional neural network algorithm based on automatic encoder still has some limitations, such as random zeroing and noise injection during training, which leads to the loss of some key information and serious training time. Convolutional neural network has the characteristics of nonlinear nonconvexity, multi-layer hidden structure, feature vectorization, massive model parameters, etc., but its weak explanation is a huge obstacle to its theoretical development and practical application. With the rapid development of computer vision, the blind image processing technology is widely used in power grid, including fault identification of power grid equipment, monitoring of power grid equipment running status, etc. As the basic punishment of power grid equipment image processing, the segmentation algorithm of power grid equipment image has always been the focus of research. The previous image segmentation algorithms include edge-based segmentation algorithm, region-based segmentation algorithm, broad-based segmentation algorithm, interactive segmentation algorithm based on graph theory and so on.},

  abstract={VisionAI is a mobile application designed to enhance the in-store shopping experience for individuals with vision impairments. Existing AI-supported apps either provide too much or too little information leading to frustration. Using the typical assistive technology design approach, we co-designed our app with a blind graduate student, focusing on the specific challenges with existing apps. While tailored to one individual’s needs, we believe the resulting app addresses broader limitations in existing shopping applications used by people with vision impairments. Here we present the design process and feedback from our co-designer that indicates VisionAI’s potential in empowering people and fostering a more inclusive shopping environment.},

  abstract={Due to the advancements in artificial intelligence and metaverse technologies, online virtual fitting has become a retail promotion application project that various e-commerce platforms are vying to develop. We discussed three virtual fitting implementation schemes, namely 2D, 3D, and metaverse-based, available for e-commerce merchant to choose from. However, none of these schemes has yet become a killer application for e-commerce platforms. Factors such as the fit and authentication of virtual fitting, user acceptance, merchant cooperation between designers and manufacturers, and the presence of a recommendation system on the platform all influence the feasibility of an online virtual fitting platform. This study employed AHP to construct a multi-level analysis model. The research results show that the 2D virtual fitting scheme is the most feasible, while the 3D virtual fitting and metaverse-based virtual fitting rank second and third respectively. It is believed that in the near future, virtual fitting will become an essential solution for e-commerce platforms, benefiting both merchants and consumers. Consumers will not waste time and money on blind purchases, and merchants and brand designers will be able to manage their products better, reduce the return rate, and provide consumers with a better shopping experience},

  abstract={Neural networks have shown promise when applied to video games and have proven effective at performing tasks such as dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA). This paper explores how an evolving neural network can be applied to a tower defense game in order to generate dynamic content with the intent of increasing player engagement through the principals of flow. A NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) neural network (NN) was trained as a wave manager to observe the current game state and generate an opposing enemy wave which best challenges the players' current tower defenses. The resulting network was compared against manually designed human waves in a blind A/B test using the Games Experience Questionnaire (GEQ) to evaluate the waves across a range of criteria. The results show that an approach like this could be viable if used for content generation purposes as no discernible difference existed in reported player experience between AI and human designed waves. However, the findings regarding subsequent increases to player engagement were inconclusive. More research is required in this field to conclusively determine if machine learning generated content can exceed the quality of content created by human designers, but the findings of this paper indicate that this approach may prove valuable to game developers in the near future by allowing them to save time and money by having AI generate content instead of requiring costly human game designer time.},

  abstract={The paradigm of semantic and goal-oriented communication offers a transition toward highly efficient AI-native connect-compute-actuate 6G networks. Unlike current content-blind communication and ML/AI training, interactions among intelligent agents capture essential information properties, facilitating practical support for understanding and effective goal attainment. However, its full potential is hindered by excessive energy consumption, wireless system resource consumption, and computational limitations. Graph-based knowledge and communication systems effectively represent, communicate, and process complex, causal, structural, and multidimensional semantic meanings. Operating in terms of semantic entities, relationships, contextual logic, and reasoning rules, these systems face challenges in transmitting graphs over classical wireless channels, given the associated resource costs. To overcome this, we explore integrating quantum technology into semantic communication, presenting a novel approach - quantum semantic communications. In our study, we focus on sharing semantic knowledge graphs through quantum mechanical principles, utilizing remote state preparation within quantum protocols. We evaluate the tradeoffs between semantic graphs and quantum channel costs to determine the feasibility of our protocol. Additionally, we explore the scalability of the quantum approach and demonstrate the computational gains achievable in polynomial time.},

  abstract={Vision-Cart is a cutting-edge assistive system on smart glasses to improve the shopping experience, with the aim of assisting visually impaired individuals by utilizing advanced AI and computer vision technologies. The goal of this project is to create an AI-based object detection system with which visually impaired individuals can easily move around and identify objects in their surroundings. With a high-resolution camera, the system translates visual data and YOLOv5 enables real-time object detection, identifying individual objects, shelves, and other useful items. These objects are conveyed to the user in real-time audio signals via earphones, making it simpler to interact with the shopping environment. This wearable technology, owing to its simplicity, enables shopping as an independent and accessible process, offering visually impaired consumers greater accessibility, confidence, and independence in daily activities. Compared to existing models such as SSD MobileNet (accuracy of 90%) and Faster R-CNN (accuracy of 96%), the proposed Vision-Cart system utilizing YOLOv5n achieves an overall detection accuracy of 98%, ensuring both reliability and real-time performance. Blind consumers tend to face challenges in identifying products on their own while shopping because of the lack of efficient assistive technologies. This paper resolves the problem through the creation of Vision-Cart, an IoT-based smart glasses platform consisting of a high-resolution camera, YOLOv5n object detection, OCR, and a text-to-speech (TTS) module for real-time product recognition. The platform takes product images, undergoes processing through computer vision algorithms, and provides audio feedback through earphones. The result shows increased accuracy in object recognition and shopping independence, which allows visually impaired users to make their own choices without any outside help.},
