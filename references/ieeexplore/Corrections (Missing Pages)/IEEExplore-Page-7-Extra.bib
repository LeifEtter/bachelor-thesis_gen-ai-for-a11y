  abstract={Disability is defined as a situation in which one must rely on others help to meet daily needs. Visual impairment is one of them. Several approaches to improving the quality to live for visually impaired and blind people have been proposed so far, buying things in the store without the help of others is always a difficult undertaking for them. A camera-based assistive text reading framework is being developed as a solution to aid blind individuals in reading text labels and product packaging from hand-held objects in their shopping store. To distinguish the object from crowded backdrops or other nearby objects in the camera view, we used an old, active motion-based method to focus a region of interest (ROI) in the picture by asking the user to shake the object. Based on real-time situations, the voice instructions will aid the user inside the supermarket. The maj or goal of this system is to eliminate other people's assistance in shopping for visually impaired persons by providing them with a convenient, smart environment. When this prototype method is implemented, that makes shopping and product purchasing easier for blind people, saves time for customers, and increases business sales. Where user interface difficulties are investigated and the algorithm's robustness in extracting and reading text from objects with complicated backgrounds is evaluated.},
