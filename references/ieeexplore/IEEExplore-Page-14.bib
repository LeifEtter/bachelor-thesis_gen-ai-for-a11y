  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy is the most common complication of diabetes mellitus and a major cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Despite significant advances, effective treatment options remain limited, especially for proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. This paper presents a new Prognosis of Microaneurysm and Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PMNPDR) detection framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation of retinal fundus images. Using integration of sophisticated technologies such as convolutional 3D layers, pooling, and activation with ReLU gives the potential feature extraction ability which reduces overfitting. By using PMNPDR architecture the accuracy comes around 99.6 % followed by 98.11 % and 99.32 % with sensitivity and specificity respectively, indicating a drastic improved performance against most of the commonly used architectures for example, AlexNet, VGGNet and GoogleNet, etc. Accurate classification of DR stages by the system has proved that deep learning models can transform early diagnosis and thus lead to timely interventions with better patient outcomes. This study underlines the importance of harnessing AI-driven solutions for superior diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in combating DR.},

  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most dangerous consequences of diabetes that cause lifelong blindness. It has become more widespread in recent years. Furthermore, diabetic patients' retinal blood vessels are damaged by DR. Consequently, several DL with AI methods have been put out to automatically detect anomalies in DR, distinct phases from photographs of the retina. This study introduces DRC-PCS-ANN, a novel neural network architecture based on pyramidal convolution and shuffle attention, for effective diabetic retinopathy classification. As a first step, input images were acquired from the MESSIDOR database. Following acquisition, noise is removed from the images through pre-processing using Data-Adaptive Gaussian Average Filtering (DAGAF). In the subsequent step, statistical features like Mean, Kurtosis, Variance, and Entropy are extracted using the One-Dimensional Quantum Integer Wavelet S-Transform. Finally, the extracted features are fed into PCSANN for effective classification of Diabetic Retinopathy into five categories: No DR, Mild DR, Moderate DR, Severe DR, and Proliferative DR. Then, performance of DRC-PCS-ANN examined utilizing performance metrics like accuracy, precision, F1-score. The DRC-PCS-ANN method attains 21.28%, 21.52% and 20.34% higher accuracy, 23.29%, 23.83% and 21.72% higher precision and compared with existing DR classifiers such as DR Classification depend on Multipath CNN with ML classifiers (DRC-MCNN-MLC), Automated DR screening for Primary Care Settings utilizing DL (ADR-PCS-DL) and Automatic DR diagnosis utilizing Adaptive Fine-Tuned CNN (ADR-AFT-CNN) respectively.},

  abstract={Diabetes mellitus causes diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is the primary source of blindness worldwide. Initial identification and cure are required to postpone or avert visual degradation and loss. In this regard, various artificial-intelligence-powered approaches for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy on fundus retina pictures have been proposed by the scientific community. This paper will mostly examine existing early DR diagnostic tools to determine their merits and drawbacks. Although pictures from fluorescein angiography, colour fundus medical images or visual lucidity tomography angiography are used for early diagnosis. Only colour fundus medical images are included in this study. It is possible to categorise the early DR detection methods described in this paper as either classical image processing, traditional machine learning, or deep learning. The issues that must be addressed in creating such efficient, effective and resilient methods for initial detection of DR systems are discussed in length in this study, as is the substantial opportunity for future research in this field.},

Here, we describe our approach for glaucoma detection in the Artificial Intelligence for Robust Glaucoma Screening challenge based on ocular fundus images. We first use object detection to focus on the most relevant part of the image and then use an ensemble of classification networks. Ungradability is rated by combining the reliability score during object detection with an explicit rating of an ungradability neural network. We achieve a sensitivity of detecting glaucoma of 0.8396 at 95% specificity and an area under the curve of 0.9852 for ungradability detection.},

  abstract={Diabetic retinopathy is a common retina disease caused by diabetes, which is increasing rapidly worldwide along with diabetic Mellitus. It is very difficult to diagnose in the beginning as it is asymptomatic, which leads to blindness. Presently, there are about 422 million diabetes patients, and it is projected that the number will be 552 million in 2030, as per a report from the World Health Organization. With the advancement in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision fields, many CNN-powered models have been developed for the detection and classification of DR using color fundus images. Early diagnosis of DR will increase recovery and decrease the possibility of vision loss threats. In this study, we aim to classify Diabetic Retinopathy in two stages, diseased versus healthy images. Three different pre-trained CNN models, namely, VGG16, InceptionV3, and MobileNet were deployed through transfer learning. Messidor and Messidor-2, two publicly available datasets are used in the training and testing of these CNN models. In terms of classification accuracy, the highest result of 84% was obtained using InceptionV3, whereas MobileNet and VGG16 shows 83% and 78% accuracy, respectively.

  abstract={Diabetes is long-lasting disease to causes a health care crisis , but it is challenging to predict without medical tests According to the International Diabetes Federation, there are currently 537 million people living with diabetes worldwide. By the year 2045, this number is projected to double, reaching 783 million. Diabetes is a disorder triggered by the abnormal increase in blood glucose levels. This excess blood glucose produces the symptoms of urination, inceased thirst, and improved hunger. Diabetes is a significant contributor to various health complications, including blindness, kidney failure, amputations, heart failure, and strokes. When we consume food, our body processes it into sugars, or glucose. Machine learning algorithms can process vast amounts of data in medicine, revealing confidential information. The aim of study to investigate how machine learning algorithms can used to predict disease. Decision Trees, Numpy, Support Vector Machine are used to predict the diabetes using machine learning techniques. All these machine learning methods/algorithms can examine vast amounts of data, enabling medical practitioners to make more cost- effective judgments. By analyzing clinical data, establishing connections among multiple diagnostic variables, building a predictive model, and comparing it to a new dataset, the study found that the Support Vector Machine Classifier predicted diabetes illnesses with 80% accuracy. The study found that employing a larger dataset for train and test can improve the model's accuracy and modify different hyperparameters. The study concludes that artificial intelligence using ML modeling can categorize people with or without diabetes.},

  abstract={Glaucoma is one of the most critical retinal diseases that can cause irreversible blindness if not treated in time. The primary detection of this disease is usually done based on the diameter measurement of optic disc (OD) region in a color fundus image. Many artificial intelligence based expert systems were developed to automatically segment the OD region of a given fundus image. Most of the recent research in this direction employs a variant of convolution neural network based U-Net architecture, which substantially increases the computational load on the training system. Also, these methods are invariant to the pose, orientation, and spatial relationship of OD to other lesions in a given fundus image. In this letter, we propose a novel lightweight W-capsule network, which uses capsules for semantic segmentation through selective routing. The instantaneous vectors of the W-shaped structure at the bottom of the network accurately extract the shape of OD along with its orientation and spatial relationship to other fundus biomarkers, making it unique in compensating for variations due to image acquisition settings. The model was trained and validated on the Indian diabetic retinopathy image dataset, DRISHTI, and RIM-ONE datasets and achieved near state-of-the-art accuracy (acc) of 0.995 and intersection over union score of 0.931 with only 2.68M computational parameters, which is only 8.64% of most widely used U-Net-based segmentation structure.},

  abstract={Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in the analysis of ophthalmic imaging. Binary Segmentation is one type of segmentation that segments the retinal vessel and blood vessel in retinal images. Retinal vascular geometry reflects a patient's state of health and aids in the diagnosis of certain conditions, including hypertension and diabetes. Early detection of these diseases helps to prevent blindness of patients. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are two important sectors in Artificial Intelligence. Nowadays, Deep learning algorithms are very much used in Medical Image processing. These Deep Learning Algorithms are more accurate and efficient than manual segmentation and other computer-aided diagnosis methods. Especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Deep Learning Architecture are used for the segmentation process. CNN architecture can handle the complex characteristics of retinal images. Traditional Data augmentation techniques are used to enlarge the training and testing samples. Matched filter methods are used to remove the noise and Morphological operations are implemented to detect the abnormal regions in the retinal image. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of 97.87%, precision of 96.8%, Intersection over Union of 97.1%, and specificity of 0.5% in the segmentation process. The proposed CNN architecture not only expedites the segmentation process but it makes advancements in clinical decisions in the field of ophthalmology.},

  abstract={Optical Coherence Tomography is a non-invasive medical imaging method used to create images of the retina in eyes, which can be vital to diagnose visual health and diseases. Retinal diseases can partially damage the retina, causing visual problem and even blindness. Therefore, early and precise detection of retinal diseases is crucial to avoid vision deterioration. In recent years, artificial intelligence algorithms have been increasingly developed to automatic identification and classification of medical images that help doctors to improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis. In this work, we propose a simple and effective model of automatic classification for Macular hole and Diabetic macular edema diseases based on optical coherence tomography images by using the Support Vector Machine. Our proposed model is also evaluated by different training data and real images. The high accuracy values of macular hole and diabetic macular edema classifications are up to 95.8% and 86.7% respectively. Our obtained results can be used to effectively assist doctors in the early diagnosis and treatment of such retinal diseases.},

  abstract={Due to the recent existence of large datasets and advancements in processing capabilities, deep learning has risen to the forefront of artificial intelligence on a variety of tasks, particularly those related to image classification and pattern recognition. Ophthalmology offers a chance to see how deep learning classifiers are used in medicine. Globally, glaucoma is the prime factor of chronic blindness and disability. Despite this, most patients are unsure whether they have glaucoma, and detecting glaucoma progression with present technology is challenging in clinical practice. We can detect glaucoma early with the help of deep learning technology. The segmentation of the optic disc and classification of glaucoma using retinal data will be examined using several deep structured learning approaches in this research. Also presented a basic understanding of deep learning. Finally, the difficulties that deep learning models face are highlighted.},

  abstract={According to the survey carried out by the World Health Organization (WHO), globally a minimum of 2.2 billion persons are impacted with vision defacement. Despite that, almost half of them could have been prevented or have to be addressed yet. Glaucoma is thought to be the third-largest cause of visual loss and blindness. Glaucoma is one of the non-communicable visual diseases, which damages the optic nerve head. When someone is detected with an eye disorder, it can’t be dealt with entirely, but it can possible to control with timely identification and proper treatment. If glaucoma is not always identified in time, it will bring about vision impairment by means of adverse effects on the optic nerve head. The glaucoma diagnosis is achieved by the Optic Disc (OD) and Optic Cup (OC) boundaries in the retinal images, this may be recorded with a fundus camera. In the present scenario, several image processing and artificial intelligence techniques are utilized to segment and categorize the optic disc and optic cup, which are fundamental to ocular images. To intensify the exactness of early-level glaucoma identification, the prevailing methods can have modifications in different and characteristic choices of the retinal photographs. This paper helps with a different approach to RNFL and ISNT based glaucoma detection and classification of retinal images. The experimental results prove that, for different classifiers and feature combinations, the diagnostic accuracy of PNN is better than that of other classifiers used. The implemented system gives a maximum accuracy of 96.25%, sensitivity of 95.83%, and specificity of 96.67% for the PNN classifier.},

  abstract={Bacterial keratitis is one of the common corneal diseases. Without timely and appropriate treatment, it can lead to complications such as vision reduction and perforation may occur, and in severe cases, it may even lead to blindness. In this study, aim to develop an artificial intelligence model for activity classification in bacterial keratitis using three types of anterior segment images: broad, slit, and scatter. By applying the patch technique, the highest AUROC of the model trained from the original was improved from 0.802 to 0.897. Performance experiments based on image combinations demonstrated that the model using only slit images showed the best results.},

  abstract={In this research, we address the critical issue of precise Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) diagnosis, a condition of ten leading severe vision impairment or blindness in diabetic patients. Leveraging advanced deep learning models and innovative image processing techniques, our study focuses on accurate retinal image segmentation using a UNet model. This segmentation method delineates lesions and retinal structures effectively. Subsequently, Gabor filters are applied for intricate texture pattern extraction, indicative of diverse retinopathy stages. Integrating MobileNetV2 for feature extraction and EfficientNetB0 for multi-class classification significantly enhances the diagnostic accuracy. Our developed system exhibits a promising 91.2% test accuracy, showcasing its potential in DR diagnosis. While challenges related to varying severity levels persist, our robust framework lays the groundwork for future refinements. By amalgamating sophisticated image segmentation, feature extraction, and classification techniques, our system provides a solid foundation for accurate and timely DR assessment. With continuous enhancements, including the incorporation of more extensive and diverse datasets, our approach holds the promise to revolutionize DR diagnostics. The integration of cutting-edge technology into medical practices underscores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence in the realm of ophthalmology, promising improved patient outcomes.},

  abstract={Retinal ischemia is caused by diabetes which affects small arteries including retinopathy. It is a condition marked by the deterioration of the retina's growth.This worse progression of Retinal ischemia may lead to the complete blindness. In this case, early detection of diabetes and retinal ischemia is more crucial to detect the lesions affected and provide the proper guidance and treatment to the patients suffering from diabetes. The identification of RI can be done manually and automatically. In the manual process, analysis and explanation is given by ophthalmologists and opticians. It is a time taking process and expensive. In case of automation process, early detection of RI can be done by automated systems using Artificial intelligence and deep learning over traditional methods. Most of the research work has done based on early detection of RI by taking two major facets fundus images and RI detection techniques.},

  abstract={Diabetes mellitus is a dangerous global epidemic that can cause kidney failure, heart attack, blindness, and death. The main cause of this disease is too high blood sugar levels due to the irrelevant work of pancreatic beta cells. Rapid computer technology advances and implementations based on artificial intelligence have penetrated various fields, especially the health sector. Data mining and machine learning are technologies that continue to grow, are reliable, and can be used as research support tools in the medical field. This technology is considered capable of helping to automate diabetes prediction. Based on related research, our contribution to this research is to utilize the CatBoost method with Optuna optimization. In the data preprocessing stage, all 768 data sets have gone through removing outliers, normalizing features to reducing dimensions. The dataset is divided into $85 \%$ composition for training data and $15 \%$ for test data. At the feature selection stage with Correlation Pearson’s, we found that Glucose correlated with diabetes outcome or disease because it had a value range of 0.47. The results’ accuracy is considered less than optimal because it only produces an accuracy value below $80 \%$, even after optimization with Optuna. It can be seen that there was only an increase of $7 \%$ after optimizing with Optuna.},
