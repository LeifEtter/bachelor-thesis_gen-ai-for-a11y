Research Phase:

AI was consulted when making a decision to certain papers, when i was uncertain if the inclusion/exclusion criteria apply, or when inclusion/exclusion criteria wasn't defined enough to make a decision.
Example Question: 
    Question Summary: A paper which was investigating Generative AI for XR Acessibility was found during keywoard searching. During Full Text Screening i was debating whether or not to include it,
    because the inclusion criteria was unclear, as this is neither pure VAT nor pure non-VAT technology. 
    Answer Summary: Gemini advised me to exclude the paper due to the nature of the technology being VAT in itself.

AI was consulted when asking for specific details on a certain step in the process of an SLR.
Example Question: 
    Quote: "When snowballing, should I directly perform full text screening or just skim and add papers based on abstract and title and perform full text screening later?"
